## Bret's DockerCon 2017 Video: "Journey to Docker Production" ##

[YouTube video of my talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdUcKtg84T8) at DockerCon17 in Austin. My largest audience ever (1k maybe) so I was excited and nervous at first. It turned into a well received talk to a packed room of people ready to go production Docker. Lots of Q&A at the end.

Then I did it again for DockerCon EU 6 months later! I think this one is better, and more fun, because I give you 80's and 90's video game trivia along the way. You can [watch this improved and revised version](https://dockercon.docker.com/watch/WdAeLaLuSCNQwEp61YVXUt) on Docker's site (it requires you give them your email, sorry).

I talk about many of the decisions you need to make when taking your Docker containers from local dev/test to a production cluster. It covers decisions like:

* What host OS should I use?
* What base FROM images should I use?
* How should my Swarm node design look?
* What other tools besides Swarm do I need for production containers?
* What common issues do people have when starting a production docker project?
* How to limit the project from trying to change too much at once.
* How to speed up the project by outsourcing small pieces of solution to existing products.
* How Docker's Enterprise/Cloud products can help.

## Swarm Raft Quorum and Recovery (Laura Frank from DockerCon 2017) ##

Also from DockerCon 2017, fellow Docker Captain and friend Laura Frank had a great session on the internals of Swarm Managers and how quorum of their Raft log works, called ["Everything You Thought You Already Knew About Orchestration"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsv-q8WbIZY). She goes into the math of how you always need an odd number of Managers, and what happens when one or more fail.

She then shows various recovery options in case you "loose quorum" in your Swarm cluster. This video is demo heavy, so it's worth watching the whole thing!
