All examples and assignment files are in a [single code repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bretfisher/udemy-docker-mastery). Each folder represents a single lecture video (but not all lectures have a folder, as not all need code).

If you're rather new to GitHub, you can download the GUI to make it very easy to push/pull code at [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/) for Mac and Windows. A great alternative Git client is [https://www.gitkraken.com/](https://www.gitkraken.com/).
