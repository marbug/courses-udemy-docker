# Editor for Docker #

You'll need a text or code editor. Preferably one that can do Syntax Highlighting for Dockerfile and YAML files.

Good free ones are

* [GitHub's Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* or even [VIM](http://spacevim.org/) if you're into shell-based editors.
