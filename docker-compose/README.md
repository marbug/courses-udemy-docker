# Making it easier with Docker Compose: the multi-container tool #

* Why: configure relationships between containers
* Why: save our docker container run settings in easy-to-read file
* Why: create one-liner developer environment startups

* Comprised of 2 separate but related things
    1. YAML-formatted file that describes our solution options for
        * containers
        * networks
        * volumes
    2. A CLI tool **docker-compose** used for local dev/test automation with those YAML files

* TODO
